# Loan Approval Prediction Using Logistic Regression.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant features. Using Logistic Regression, the model analyzes past data to uncover decision patterns and streamline the loan approval process.
## Project Structure
Data Loading – Load the loan application dataset,
Data Cleaning – Handle duplicates, missing values, and clean column names,
Data Encoding – Convert categorical features using label encoding,
Model Training – Train a Logistic Regression model,
Model Evaluation – Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics,
Conclusion – Summarize outcomes and insights from the model.
## Technologies Used
Python,
Pandas, NumPy – Data cleaning and manipulation,
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization,
Scikit-learn – Model building, training, and evaluation.
## Conclusion
In this project, a Logistic Regression model was developed to predict loan approval decisions based on a range of applicant information, including credit history, employment status, income, and loan amount.
